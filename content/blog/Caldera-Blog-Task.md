# MITRE Caldera: Automating Adversary Emulation for Enhanced Security

## What is MITRE Caldera?
Caldera is a cybersecurity framework developed by MITRE to assist security professionals in automating adversary emulation, thereby reducing the time, cost, and effort associated with manual security assessments. Built upon the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework, Caldera enables users to simulate real-world cyber threats, test defenses, and train blue teams effectively.

## Key Features of Caldera
### 1. Autonomous Adversary Emulation
Caldera allows security teams to create specific threat profiles and deploy them within their networks. This simulation helps identify vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of existing security measures.

### 2. Automated Security Assessments
By automating routine testing, Caldera frees up valuable resources, enabling security teams to focus on more complex challenges.

### 3. Plugin Architecture
Caldera's modular design supports a variety of plugins that extend its core functionalities. Notable plugins include:

- **Sandcat**: An extensible agent for executing adversary techniques on target systems.
- **Stockpile**: A repository of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- **Manx**: A remote access tool that facilitates command-and-control operations.

## Recent Developments
MITRE has introduced several enhancements to Caldera:

- **Bounty Hunter Plugin**: Enables intelligent cyber adversary emulation by automating the discovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- **Caldera for Operational Technology (OT)**: Emulates adversary behaviors in OT environments, aiding in the protection of critical infrastructure.

## Getting Started with Caldera
The platform offers comprehensive documentation covering installation, configuration, and usage guidelines. You can access the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mitre/caldera).

# Getting Started with MITRE Caldera: A Step-by-Step Guide
MITRE Caldera is a powerful, open-source adversary emulation platform designed for red teams and defenders to automate security assessments. It allows users to simulate cyberattacks, test defenses, and gain insights into vulnerabilities.

## 1. Prerequisites
Before installing Caldera, ensure you meet the following requirements:

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: Version **3.8 or higher**
- **Git**: Installed for cloning the repository
- **Network Access**: Required for installing dependencies

## 2. Installing Caldera
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git --recursive
cd caldera
```

The `--recursive` flag ensures that all submodules are cloned as well.

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Start the Server
```bash
python server.py --insecure
```

The `--insecure` flag allows access without authentication (use only for testing). For production, set up proper authentication.

### Step 5: Access the Web Interface
Once the server is running, open a browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8888
```

Log in with the default credentials:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin`

You can change this password later for security reasons.

## 3. Setting Up Agents for Adversary Emulation
To simulate attacks, you need to deploy **agents** (Sandcat) on target machines.

### Deploying an Agent on Windows
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://YOUR_SERVER:8888/file/download -OutFile agent.exe
.\agent.exe -server http://YOUR_SERVER:8888
```

The agent should appear in the **Agents** tab in the Caldera UI.

### Deploying an Agent on Linux
```bash
wget http://YOUR_SERVER:8888/file/download -O agent.sh
chmod +x agent.sh
./agent.sh -server http://YOUR_SERVER:8888
```

---

## 4. Running Your First Adversary Simulation
### Step 1: Create an Operation
1. In the **Operations** tab, click **New Operation**.
2. Select an adversary profile (e.g., `Stockpile`, a built-in MITRE ATT&CK profile).
3. Choose an **Agent** (your deployed agent).
4. Click **Start Operation**.

Caldera will now execute the adversary's **TTPs** (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) against the target system. You can monitor the logs in real-time.

---

## 5. Expanding Caldera with Plugins
Caldera supports various plugins to extend its capabilities:

| Plugin   | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **Sandcat**  | Deploys agents on target systems |
| **Stockpile** | Provides a database of TTPs for adversary emulation |
| **Manx** | Interactive remote access tool |
| **Training** | Simulates security awareness training scenarios |

### Installing a Plugin
```bash
cd caldera/plugins
git clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera-stockpile.git
```
Then restart the Caldera server.

---

## 6. Automating Tasks with Caldera API
You can interact with Caldera programmatically using its **REST API**. For example, listing all active agents:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8888/api/v2/agents -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
For advanced automation, consider integrating Caldera with your **SIEM** or **SOAR** platform.

---

## 7. Hardening Caldera for Production Use
If using Caldera in a **production** or **corporate** environment:
- **Enable authentication**: Set up a secure admin password.
- **Use HTTPS**: Configure SSL certificates.
- **Restrict access**: Run the server behind a firewall or VPN.
